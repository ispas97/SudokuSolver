 Implemented a board finding and reshaping algorithm as a part of solution of a Sudoku Solver machine learning application 
 
Implemented Hough Transform algorithm for finding lines on a picture filtered with Canny edge detector and written functions to select only lines that belong to a board 
 
Written a series of functions that not only find the board lines but add the missing lines and map the given warped board to a square like board to be more appealing to the user 
Implementation was done in C++
